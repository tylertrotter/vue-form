# TODO

- make certain components global
	- button
	- section
	- scope CSS using a class-based strategy https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Component-style-scoping-essential
	- First header no margin top, all headers no margin bottom.
	- Do I need to bring back the field component?
	- Do I need c-row?
	- Get css files to be generated from scss
	- If error messages were display: absolute and help text were on top, and each row of the form were in a container, and we used flexbox, we could align text fields to bottom.
